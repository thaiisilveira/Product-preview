## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I started to learn HTML and CSS quite recently, and since then my favorite way of studying is by creating small projects like this one, where I can practice what I've learned and stay aware of what I still need to work on. This project was a very good way to practice the grid display, since this property was a bit tricky for me at first.

### Continued development

I plan on studying more about grids, columns, and other ways of displaying content since I'm not particularly confident about it yet. There are many other CSS concepts I still need to reinforce, so I plan on doing it before moving on to Javascript (since I plan on working as a front-end developer in the future).

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](w3schools.com) - A great go-to guide for whatever questions I might have during the coding processing.
